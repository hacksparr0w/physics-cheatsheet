    "  - The molecules of the gas are indistinguishable, small, hard spheres\n",
    "  - The average distance between molecules is much larger than the size of the molecules\n",
    "  - There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the molecules apart from those that determine their point-like collisions\n",
    "  - The molecules are constantly moving in random directions\n",
    "  - The only forces between the gas molecules and the surroundings are those that determine the point-like collisions of the molecules with the walls\n",
